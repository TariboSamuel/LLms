        "In the context of AI models, a multi-turn conversation is a type of interaction where the model and user engage in a back-and-forth dialogue, spanning multiple exchanges of information. This contrasts with single-turn interactions where the model generates a response based only on the current prompt without considering any previous context.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how the code snippet you provided helps achieve multi-turn conversations:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Creating a ChatSession object:\n",
        "\n",
        "* The line chat = `model.start_chat(history=[])` creates a new ChatSession object.\n",
        "* This object acts as a container for managing the conversation's state, including the history of previous messages and the model's current understanding of the context.\n",
        "* The `history=[]` argument indicates that the conversation is starting fresh without any prior context.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Using `model.start_chat()` instead of `model.generate_content()`:\n",
        "\n",
        "* The `model.start_chat()` method specifically initiates a multi-turn conversation mode.\n",
        "* It differs from `model.generate_content()`, which is typically used for single-turn responses based on a single prompt.\n",
        "\n",
        "__Key features of multi-turn conversations with `ChatSession`:__\n",
        "\n",
        "* __Persistent context:__ The model maintains a memory of previous exchanges within the ChatSession, allowing it to reference past information and build context over multiple turns.\n",
        "* __Dynamic responses:__ The model's responses can evolve as the conversation progresses, adapting to new information, questions, or requests from the user.\n",
        "* __Natural flow:__ The conversation can feel more natural and engaging, resembling a human-to-human dialogue rather than a series of disconnected responses."
